## Aloe Vera

Originating from the Arabian Peninsula, it's now cultivated worldwide for its therapeutic properties. Aloe vera is easily recognizable by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it highly adaptable to arid conditions. &nbsp;

## Care Tips for Aloe Vera

- **Light:** Aloe vera thrives in bright, indirect light. A south-facing window is ideal, but avoid direct midday sun, which can scorch the leaves. &nbsp;
- **Watering:** Water thoroughly when the soil is completely dry. Overwatering is the most common cause of aloe vera plant death. Allow excess water to drain completely.
- **Soil:** Use a well-draining cactus and succulent mix.
- **Temperature:** Aloe vera prefers warm temperatures between 60-80°F (15-27°C).
- **Fertilizing:** Fertilize sparingly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength.
- **Propagation:** Aloe vera is easily propagated from offsets (pups) that grow at the base of the mother plant. Simply separate the pups from the main plant and allow the cut ends to callus over before planting in well-draining soil. &nbsp;

**Note:** Always wash your hands thoroughly after handling aloe vera, as the sap can irritate the skin for some individuals. &nbsp;

By following these simple care tips, you can enjoy the beauty and benefits of this versatile succulent for years to come.
